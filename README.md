# <Prework Study Guide Webage>

## Description

My motivation in creating this study guide is to better collect information givem in the prework so that I can revisit the information I learned. I built this priject so that, even though I was given a lot of information in the prework, I have a place that I can go back and study the inofrmation and nothing gets lost. This solves the problem of having to sort back through all the modules in order to find information I might be looking for. I learned many things such as git commands, HTML, CSS,  JAVASCRIPT, and how to make and work GitHub repositories.

## Usage

To use this prework study guide you should look through each section at the notes per whatever you want to study. You can navigate the website by the headers denoting what information is catalogued underneath. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
